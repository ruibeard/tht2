## Notes:
#### I did not implemented the methods `createOne` and `saveOne` as I wasn't sure if it was required for this exercise.
Please let me know if I should implement them.
Or if you prefer that I implement them with a database.

This is a base install of Laravel 9 with a few custom routes, a controller, a model and some blade views.

The user interface lists "activity" and allows users to create new activity records or edit existing records. The Activity model simulates a database connection by returning static data. It does not save any data and that is not required for the purposes of this test.

### Instructions
- Please create the ability for a user to "clone" an existing record, whilst being able to change any fields before saving
- Make any improvements to the code as you see fit
- If you run out of time, please write comments to describe what you would improve/change and how you would do it
- Commit your changes to your own repository
